Adding a single event listener to a common ancestor element, such as your ticTacToeContainer, and using it to handle events for multiple child elements is known as event delegation.

Here's a breakdown of the process:

Single Event Listener: Instead of attaching individual event listeners to each child element, you attach a single event listener to a common parent or ancestor element (in this case, ticTacToeContainer).

Event Bubbling: When an event, such as a click, occurs on a child element, the event propagates or bubbles up through the DOM hierarchy. This is the natural behavior of events in the browser.

Event Handling at Common Ancestor: The single event listener on the common ancestor (ticTacToeContainer) listens for events at the bubbling phase. When a child element triggers the event, the ancestor's event listener is called.

Checking the Target: In the event handler, you can inspect the event.target property to identify the specific child element that was clicked.

Efficient Handling: This approach is more efficient, especially when dealing with a large number of elements, as it eliminates the need to attach individual event listeners to each child. It simplifies the code and can improve performance.

In your TicTacToe implementation, the ticTacToeContainer_ClickListener function is an example of event delegation. It adds a single click event listener to ticTacToeContainer and then uses the event object to determine which specific cell was clicked.
