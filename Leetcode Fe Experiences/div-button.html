Best Practice
Always prefer button for interactive actions unless thereâ€™s a compelling reason to use a div. If you do use a div, ensure it meets the following:

Add tabindex="0" for keyboard focus.
Add role="button" for semantics.
Add keydown handlers to support Enter and Space keys.
Ensure proper styling for focus and active states.
By using a button element, you get all this functionality automatically, reducing the risk of errors and ensuring better user experience.


"Using button instead of div for click events is better because:

Semantic correctness: Buttons are designed for interactivity, while divs are for layout.
Accessibility: Buttons are keyboard and screen-reader friendly by default, whereas divs need extra effort to achieve the same.
Built-in functionality: Buttons provide default behaviors like focus, click via Enter/Space, and form submission without additional code.
Maintainability: Using buttons makes the code more understandable and aligns with web standards."
This covers the high-level rationale without going into too much detail.
