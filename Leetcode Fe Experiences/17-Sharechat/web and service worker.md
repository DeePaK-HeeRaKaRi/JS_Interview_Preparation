Feature 	Web Worker >	Service Worker
Purpose	  >  Running background tasks, parallel computation || 	Offline access, caching, intercepting network requests

Lifecycle	> Exists while the page is open	               ||   Persistent, works even when the page is closed

Communication >	postMessage with main thread	           || Event-driven, intercepts network requests

Access to DOM ?	No	                                    || No

APIs	> Limited (e.g., no DOM access)	                || Extensive (e.g., Cache API, Push API)

Security >	Same-origin policy	                        || HTTPS required for security

Caching >  No built-in caching	                        || Built-in caching through the Cache API

Use Cases	> Heavy computation, parallel tasks	        || Offline mode, push notifications, caching
