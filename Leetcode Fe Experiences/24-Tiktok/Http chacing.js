/*


HTTP caching is a mechanism that allows browsers or intermediaries (like CDNs) to store copies of responses and serve them instead of making a full server request. This improves performance by reducing latency, bandwidth usage, and server load. Key headers involved in HTTP caching are:

Cache-Control: Specifies caching directives (e.g., no-cache, max-age, public, private).
Expires: Sets an expiration date and time for a cached response.
ETag: A unique identifier (usually a hash) representing the version of a resource.
Last-Modified: Indicates the last time the resource was modified.

Preferred Choice: ETag or Last-Modified?
ETag is preferred when:

Precision is critical (e.g., dynamic or frequently updated resources).
Resources might change without altering timestamps (e.g., database-driven data).
Last-Modified is sufficient when:

Performance is a concern, and precision isn't critical.
Resources are static or change predictably over time.
