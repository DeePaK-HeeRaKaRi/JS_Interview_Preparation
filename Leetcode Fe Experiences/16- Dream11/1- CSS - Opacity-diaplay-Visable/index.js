// Display: none - > completly removed from document and the element layout can be occupied by other element
// Use Case: Useful for completely hiding an element without affecting the layout, such as for toggling visibility in JavaScript.


// visibility:hidden > Diff is layout when compared to diaplay:none,element Layout is still intact but it is invisible and but not interactivity
// Use Case: Useful when you want to hide an element but maintain its space in the layout, such as hiding tooltips or popups temporarily.

// opacity:0 > Elements with opacity: 0 on the other hand are interactable as they are actually visible, just very transparent. 
// Useful for fade-out animations where you want to maintain the layout but gradually make the element invisible.
