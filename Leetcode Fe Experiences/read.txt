Components of the Box Model
Content

This is where the actual text, images, or other content resides.
The width and height of the content can be defined explicitly or determined by the content itself.
Padding

The space between the content and the border.
Increases the visible size of the element but not its outer size.
Can be set individually for top, right, bottom, and left:
css
Copy code

Border

The line surrounding the padding (or the content, if padding is 0).
Can have width, style, and color.

Margin

The space outside the border, separating the element from other elements.
Used for spacing between elements.
