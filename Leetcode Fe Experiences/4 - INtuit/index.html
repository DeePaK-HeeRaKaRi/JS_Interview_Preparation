    <h3>Generator Functions</h3>
    <p>In JavaScript, a generator function is a special type of function that allows you to control the flow of execution and
    produce a series of values one at a time. Generator functions are defined using the function* syntax, where an asterisk
    (*) is placed after the function keyword. Here's an example of a generator function:</p>
    
    <h4>-------------------------</h4>
    <p>In the above code, myGenerator is a generator function that yields three values: 1, 2, and 3. The yield keyword is used
    to yield a value from the generator and pause its execution until the next value is requested.
    
    To use a generator, you create an iterator by calling the generator function. This iterator can be used to iterate over
    the values produced by the generator. Here's how you can use the myGenerator generator:</p>

    <h4>-------------------------</h4>
    <p>Each call to iterator.next() returns an object with two properties:
    
    value: The value yielded by the generator.
    done: A boolean indicating whether the generator has finished producing values (true when it's done).
    You can use a for...of loop to simplify the iteration process:</p>
